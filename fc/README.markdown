###  Flashchords

## WTF:

I want to be better at JavaScript, running my own web services, using proper development tools, and the acoustic guitar. If you are reading this sentence, then you might share some of those desires as well. Really, if not, then I can only conclude you are, in some sense, stalking me.

I'm a visual and hands-on learner. I wrote this app to serve three purposes: test out a number of frameworks and ideas; to do so "the right way" instead of just how I have always done it, and most importantly, to create a tool that will help me learn guitar chords by name instead of just in the context of a song.

## INSTALLATION:

Right now, everything just runs as is in any browser, so long as your environment/browser combo allows file access to relative files. Run locally, I had to run Chrome with this switch:
